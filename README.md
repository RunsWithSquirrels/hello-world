Hello everyone!
  My name is Mallory and I am learning all about coding and front-end web development. It's a lot of fun and very exciting for me! If you have any tips or tricks, please let me know! :)
  
  I have now completed a Nanodegree thanks to Google and Udacity that has helped me to futher understand HTML, CSS, Javascript, and front-end web devoplment as a whole, so I am much more confident working with coding and git - as well as GitHub! I can't wait to learn more coding skills (like learning Python) and earn more certifications!
